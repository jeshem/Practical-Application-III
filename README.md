Objective: The main objective is to compare four classifiers: k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines. To this end, a dataset of customers of a telephone campaign is analyzed. Features of the dataset include age, job, 

Conclusion: Of these four classifiers, the nearest neighbors classifier has a training time of 0.03 seconds and a test score of 0.904. Logistic regression, meanwhile, has a higher test score of 0.908 which is higher than nearest neighbors. However, it also has a training time of 1.17 seconds, about 39 times slower than nearest neighbors.
